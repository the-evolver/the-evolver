## 🚀 About Me

I’m Atul, a Software Engineer passionate about building resilient backend architectures and intuitive frontend interfaces. I specialize in cloud-native applications, real-time distributed systems, and scaling solutions that work flawlessly across the tech stack.

Whether it's optimizing a DynamoDB query from 600ms to 150ms, creating RAG tools with OpenAI, or setting up GitHub Actions to slash hotfix deployment times — I do it with performance and elegance in mind.
